## 🔗 API Endpoints

### Lawyer Verification Endpoints

```

### Admin Verification Dashboard
```
GET  /api/admin/verifications/pending        - Get pending verifications
GET  /api/admin/verifications/stats          - Get verification statistics
GET  /api/admin/verifications/:lawyerId      - Get verification details
POST /api/admin/verifications/:lawyerId/approve    - Approve verification

```

## 📊 Verification Workflow

1. **Lawyer Registration**
   - Lawyer creates profile with basic information
   - Optional: Submit certificate number for auto-verification
   - Verification record created with PENDING status

2. **Certificate Auto-Verification**
   - System checks certificate against Ghana Bar database
   - Intelligent matching with similarity scoring
   - Updates verification status if successful

3. **Document Submission**
   - Lawyer uploads required documents (Bar Certificate, ID, CV, etc.)
   - Status changes to UNDER_REVIEW
   - Documents tracked by type

4. **Admin Review Process**
   - Admin reviews submitted documents
   - Can approve, reject, or require resubmission
   - Admin notes and rejection reasons tracked

5. **Final Approval**
   - Approved lawyers get `isVerified: true` status
   - `verifiedAt` timestamp recorded
   - Full access to platform features

## 🧪 Testing Results

The system has been tested and verified:

```bash
✅ Database schema migration successful
✅ Prisma client generation complete
✅ Certificate verification working (tested with real data)
✅ All API endpoints functional
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ Type safety maintained
```

### Test Example
```javascript
// Certificate verification test
const result = await verifyLawyerCertificate({
  certificateNumber: 'GAR 11351 / 15',
  nameOfLawyer: 'AARON ARNOLD ANIM'
});

// Result:
{
  verified: true,
  certificate: { ... },
  matchScore: 1.0,
  message: 'Certificate verified successfully'
}
```
